# Codex Journal

Use this file to capture session-level notes. Each entry should record tasks attempted, outcomes, and follow-up actions.

## 2025-09-21 Repository bootstrap
- Created initial community repository structure, governance docs, and sample toolkit scaffold.

## 2025-09-22 Toolkit automation overhaul
- Reworked toolkit sync to mirror docs from `toolkits/<slug>/docs/README.md`, publish bundle redirects, and regenerate the catalog manifest.
- Updated sample and regex toolkits to the unified manifest structure and refreshed published documentation.
- Cleaned navigation, README guidance, and AI context to reflect the new workflow.

## 2025-09-22 Validation and backlog refresh
- Ran `scripts/validate-repo.sh` successfully; captured that the MkDocs build step fails locally because MkDocs is not installed.
- Logged new documentation-site backlog items to pin MkDocs dependencies and add CI coverage for the documentation build.

## 2025-09-23 Toolkit documentation audit
- Added missing README, CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, TESTING, and BUILDING docs for API Checker, Connectivity, Latency Sleuth, Toolbox Health, and Zabbix toolkits.
- Ran scripts/sync_toolkit_assets.py per toolkit to regenerate published docs and catalog entries; noted validate-repo requires templates manifest.
- MkDocs build still blocked by missing mkdocs binary in environment; captured in progress notes for follow-up.

## 2025-09-23 Catalog metadata backfill
- Populated catalog metadata blocks (version, categories, tags, maintainers) for recently documented toolkits and normalized slugs to underscore style.
- Regenerated catalog/toolkits.json via sync script; validate_catalog and validate-repo succeed with python3 alias workaround.
- mkdocs build --strict still fails locally because mkdocs is not installed; captured as follow-up for dependency pinning.

## 2025-10-01 Subnet toolkit refresh
- Restyled the Subnet toolkit panel to use shared card patterns, iconography, and inline styles consistent with Latency Sleuth.
- Added inline calculator/table refinements for better readability and responsive layout, including loading and error affordances.
- Bumped the toolkit manifest to version 0.3.0 and updated AI state to record the release.
