    <h1>Download sample-toolkit bundle</h1>
    <p>
      Bundles are generated as part of the documentation build and
      published for download at
      <code>/toolkits/sample-toolkit/bundle</code>. The redirect keeps legacy
      links alive on GitHub Pages deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you reached this page directly you can use the
      <a href="bundle/">bundle redirect</a> to trigger a download.
