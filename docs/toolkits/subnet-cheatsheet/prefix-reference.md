# Prefix cheat sheet reference

The prefix reference presents a static view of the most common CIDR ranges so operators can copy subnet facts without running a
calculation. It mirrors the data generated by the calculator and the scheduled Celery task.

## Table contents

Each row lists:

- **Prefix** – network bits and host bits (for example, `/24` → `255.255.255.0`).
- **Hosts** – total addressable hosts excluding network and broadcast.
- **Wildcard mask** – the inverted subnet mask for ACLs.
- **Notes** – quick reminders about where the prefix is typically used.

## Regeneration cadence

- The prefix table regenerates whenever the bundled Celery task runs (`subnet-cheatsheet.generate_prefix_table`).
- Operators can schedule the task from the calculator UI or directly via `/toolkits/subnet-cheatsheet/jobs/prefix-table`.
- Fresh data is cached so the App Shell renders instantly for subsequent viewers.

## Sharing guidance

1. Use the **Copy table** action to paste formatted markdown into runbooks or hand-offs.
2. Download the JSON export when integrating with monitoring dashboards or CMDB automation.
3. Link this documentation page from dashboards so stakeholders understand the source of each data point.
