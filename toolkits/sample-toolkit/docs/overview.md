# Sample Diagnostics Toolkit overview

The Sample Diagnostics Toolkit is intentionally simple, serving as a reference implementation for community contributors. Operators can install it to confirm toolkit lifecycle wiring and use it as a baseline for new projects.

## Runtime components

- **Backend** – Exposes `/toolkits/sample/health` for smoke testing.
- **Worker** – Registers `sample-toolkit.run_diagnostics`, which emits a static success payload.
- **Frontend** – Renders a minimal panel including installation guidance.

## Testing

- `scripts/validate-toolkit.sh sample-toolkit`
- Manual request to `/toolkits/sample/health` should return HTTP 200 with status `ok`.

## Maintenance

The toolkit is maintained by the SRE Toolbox core team and should remain unchanged apart from doc updates demonstrating best practices.
